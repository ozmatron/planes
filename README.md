# Data structures and algorithms project

A project that delivers a fuel management software solution to a hypothetical airline company. The airline is entering the European air freight cargo business and wants a software tool to manage their fuel purchasing strategy. Each week, an aircraft will fly up to six trips. The airplane will start and end in the same home airport each week. The company has a number of different aircraft that have different fuel capacities and the cost of fuel varies from airport to airport. Given a list of 5 airports (including to the home airport) that a given plane needs to visit in a week, the most economic route must be found.

The solution uses object oriented programming in Python to deliver the output by reading the user input and using other CSV data to create the most economical route and distance.
